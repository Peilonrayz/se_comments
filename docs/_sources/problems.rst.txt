| @AndrewL64 Don't use the existence of Code Review as a reason to close a question. Evaluate the question and use a reason like; needs focus, primarily opinion-based, etc. – Peilonrayz
| @Peilonrayz I guess I made a wrong call but he stated that his code works with x amount of data but he wants it to work with xx amount of data so I thought that counts as "improving/optimising current working code". – `AndrewL64 <https://stackoverflow.com/users/4114907/andrewl64>`_
| @AndrewL64 I have not contested that. – Peilonrayz
| @Peilonrayz I wasn't implying that you are tbh. Just stating the reason from evaluating the question as you mentioned. – AndrewL64
